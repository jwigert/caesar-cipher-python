# Caesar cipher implemented in Python

A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique. See the following [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

## Prerequisites

Download and install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Execute project

Run the project by entering the following in your shell: `python3 caesar.py`

The project needs to be run with two arguments:

- Argument 1: The plain text
- Argument 2: The number of places to shift (in the range 0 to 25)

Example:

```bash
python3 caesar.py "this is the plain text" 3
```

Expected result:

```
The encrypted sentence is: wklv lv wkh sodlq whaw
